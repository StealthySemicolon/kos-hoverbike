# kOS Hoverbike
kOS code for maintaining altitude on a hoverbike in Kerbal Space Program

## Mechanics
This works by calculating the component of the force vector of the engines that points towards the grounds
using the data from the bike's pitch and roll. This allows the janky PID controller to more or less
maintain a certain altitude from the ground. The distance of ground *is not* from the bottom of the
bike, rather from the center of mass. **USE LANDING MODE WITH CAUTION**
